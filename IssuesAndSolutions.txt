In the past, I had problems getting the steam controller to work properly.

Recently, the hid_steam kernel module landed in the kernel, and I took this trouble to be the fault of hid_steam.

I blacklisted hid steam with the file /etc/modprobe.d/steam_hid_blacklist.conf contained in this repository.

At the same time, it seems I tried external solutions like the sc-controller package, but didn't get any results. At the time, I was trying to get "Ori and the Blind Forest" to work, but ran into lots of problems. It turns out that this game has a general bug that it refuses to recognize steam controllers.

I also tried the file 99-steam-controller-perms.rules in /lib/udev/rules.d/ as suggested by the website https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/you-will-need-to-update-your-udev-rules-for-the-steam-controller.8593


August 30 2019 - I am again having trouble, this time with multiple controllers popping up in Steam when I attach a steam controller. I assume some steam behaviour changed, so I again must explore the different options to solve these issues and see which work. this will require me to restart my computer a bunch of times. fun.

I will start by removing all custom configuration I added before, and hope that now the 'default' configuration works fine.

current kernel: Linux schumann 5.2.9-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Aug 16 11:29:43 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux

This seems to have worked.. Strangely, 'input' reports the new device as a 'Microsoft X-Box 360' pad. Its possible this is normal though. Here is the relevant bit from dmesg -wH:

[Aug30 20:44] hid-steam 0003:28DE:1142.0009: Steam Controller 'FC64520AD8' connected
[  +0.249657] input: Microsoft X-Box 360 pad as /devices/virtual/input/input24

Weird.
