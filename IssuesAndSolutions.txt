In the past, I had problems getting the steam controller to work properly.

Recently, the hid_steam kernel module landed in the kernel, and I took this trouble to be the fault of hid_steam.

I blacklisted hid steam with the file /etc/modprobe.d/steam_hid_blacklist.conf contained in this repository.
